  "ai_analysis": "The current market conditions suggest a transitional risk state with a cautious optimism. The defensive frontier stance is maintained due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. Energy sector shows strength, supported by rising oil prices. The banking sector is favored due to decreasing Fed Funds rates. Technology sector is considered for its innovation potential. The core allocation of 90% crypto and 10% gold remains valid, with a BTC-heavy stance in crypto due to ETH weakness.",
