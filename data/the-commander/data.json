  "ai_analysis": "The current environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk stance. Policy rates are trending downwards, supporting risk assets. The portfolio maintains a BTC-heavy stance in crypto due to BTC dominance and ETH weakness. In metals, gold is held for its safe-haven status. Sector focus includes energy due to oil strength and Saudi exposure, technology due to innovation and market strength, and banking for defensive positioning. The frontier stance remains defensive due to flat AI breakthrough frequency.",
