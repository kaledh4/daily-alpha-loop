  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional with a cautiously optimistic sentiment. The VIX is within the transitional range (14.51), and the Fear & Greed index is at 25, reinforcing a defensive bias. The Fed is continuing its easing trend, which supports risk assets. The crypto market shows a slight preference for alt/ETH rotation due to BTC.D being below 55%. Energy strength and regional signals from TASI indicate a focus on the energy and regional sectors. The defensive frontier stance is maintained due to flat AI breakthrough frequency.",
