The portfolio maintains a core crypto allocation with a focus on alt/ETH rotation due to BTC dominance being below 55%. Energy and banking sectors are favored due to oil strength and falling rates. The defensive frontier stance is maintained due to flat AI innovation velocity. Gold is held as a hedge.",
