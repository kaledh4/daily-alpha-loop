  "ai_analysis": "The current environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk toggle. The falling policy rates are favorable. The portfolio should maintain a BTC-heavy stance in crypto due to ETH weakness and a defensive frontier stance due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. Energy and Banking sectors are favored due to oil strength and falling rates. The old stand is partially valid with changes in the rate path.",
