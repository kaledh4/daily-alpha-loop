  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional with slight bullish undertones. The Fed's easing trend supports risk assets, and the VIX below 15 indicates a risk-on eligible environment. Crypto allocation should focus on alt-rotation due to BTC dominance below 55% and ETH strength. Metals allocation remains in gold. Sector focus should be on Energy, Technology, and Regional (Saudi) due to oil price stability, AI breakthroughs, and TASI strength. The frontier stance is neutral, balancing defensiveness with emerging opportunities in AI and technology.",
