  "ai_analysis": "The current environment is transitional with a slight bias towards risk-on due to falling policy rates and moderate market conditions. The portfolio should maintain a defensive stance with a focus on energy, tech, and banking sectors. Crypto allocation should favor BTC due to its dominance, while metals should hold gold. The old stand is partially valid, with adjustments needed for the transitional risk state.",
