  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment suggests a transitional risk stance. Policy rates are trending downwards, supporting a risk-on environment, but VIX and Fear & Greed indices indicate caution. Crypto allocation should focus on Alt/ETH rotation due to BTC Dominance being below 55% and ETH showing strength. Energy sector shows promise due to oil price strength. AI breakthroughs suggest long-term potential in technology sectors. Gold remains a stable hedge.",
