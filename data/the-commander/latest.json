  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional, with falling policy rates supporting risk assets. The crypto portfolio should maintain a BTC-heavy stance due to high BTC dominance and ETH weakness. The metals allocation should hold gold as a stable store of value. Sector focus should include energy, technology, and banking, with a mixed regional approach. The frontier stance remains defensive due to flat AI breakthrough frequency.",
