  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk toggle. Policy rates are trending downwards, supporting risk assets. The crypto allocation remains BTC-heavy due to ETH weakness and BTC dominance below 55%. The metals allocation holds gold with no strong signal for rotation. Sector focus includes Energy, Banking, and Technology, with a mixed regional approach. The Frontier stance remains Defensive due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. The old stand is partially valid, with shifts in Frontier Stance and Risk State.",
