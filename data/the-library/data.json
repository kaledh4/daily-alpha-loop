  "query": "What drives crypto bull markets?",
  "simplified_answer": "Crypto bull markets are primarily driven by four interconnected cycles: 1) Halving-induced supply shocks (Bitcoin's block reward reductions), 2) Monetary policy liquidity (low real interest rates and expanding central bank balance sheets), 3) Technological adoption S-curves (DeFi, NFTs, scaling solutions reaching inflection points), and 4) Network effect compounding (Metcalfe's Law valuation expansions). Historical analysis shows these factors converge every 3-4 years, creating 12-18 month parabolic rallies where assets typically appreciate 10-50x from bear market lows. The current cycle is uniquely influenced by institutional custody infrastructure maturation and AI-driven productivity gains in blockchain development.",
