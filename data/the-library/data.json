  "query": "What drives crypto bull markets?",
  "simplified_answer": "Crypto bull markets are primarily driven by a combination of macro\u2011financial conditions, technological adoption, and market sentiment. Low interest rates and abundant liquidity push investors toward higher\u2011beta assets, while innovations such as layer\u20112 scaling, DeFi, and institutional adoption increase the perceived utility and demand for digital assets. Positive sentiment, amplified by social media and mainstream media coverage, creates momentum that feeds further buying. Regulatory clarity and the entry of large institutional players also reduce perceived risk, making the market more attractive. Together, these factors create a virtuous cycle that propels prices upward.",
