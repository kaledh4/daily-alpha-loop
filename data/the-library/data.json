  "query": "What drives crypto bull markets?",
  "simplified_answer": "Crypto bull markets are typically driven by a combination of factors, including technological advancements, institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic conditions. Technological breakthroughs, such as improvements in blockchain scalability and security, can enhance the utility and appeal of cryptocurrencies. Institutional adoption, where large financial institutions and corporations invest in crypto, brings credibility and liquidity to the market. Regulatory clarity provides a stable framework for crypto operations, reducing uncertainty and attracting more participants. Favorable macroeconomic conditions, such as low interest rates and inflation concerns, can also drive investors towards crypto as a hedge against traditional financial risks. Additionally, market sentiment and the Fear & Greed Index play a significant role, with extreme fear often preceding bullish reversals. Overall, a confluence of these factors creates a positive feedback loop, fueling crypto bull markets.",
