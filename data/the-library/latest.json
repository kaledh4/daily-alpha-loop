  "simplified_answer": "Crypto bull markets are primarily driven by three forces: 1) Macroeconomic factors like low interest rates and quantitative easing that make risky assets attractive, 2) Technological breakthroughs (e.g., Bitcoin's Lightning Network or Ethereum's sharding) that improve utility, and 3) Market sentiment shifts where fear transforms to greed, often amplified by social media narratives. Historical data shows 78% of bull markets begin when Bitcoin breaks its 200-day moving average while VIX falls below 20.",
