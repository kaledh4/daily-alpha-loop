  "ai_analysis": "The global macro environment is in a late\u2011cycle phase, with GDP growth moderating and inflationary pressures building. The Fed\u2019s policy stance remains accommodative, but the 3\u2011month forecast indicates a potential tightening cycle that could dampen growth. Oil prices are stable, hovering around $57\u2013$60, which supports the Saudi economy\u2019s export revenues. The TASI index, currently flat, is poised for a modest upside as domestic consumption and investment recover. Saudi Arabia\u2019s high oil production capacity and aggressive PIF deployment provide a cushion against external shocks, while the Vision 2030 progress at 80% signals a continued focus on diversification. The convergence of these factors suggests a resilient but cautious outlook for the Saudi market, with a moderate upside potential over the next 12 months.",
