  "ai_analysis": "The macro environment is characterized by a relatively strong DXY at 98.99, which could impact emerging markets. Oil at $60.08 and Gold at $4227.70 are within recent ranges, but the SP500 at 6870.40 suggests a positive equity market tone. The TASI at 10626.15 is rangebound, driven by local factors. For the week, we expect a positive bias for TASI, driven by regional economic growth and a stable oil price.",
