The current oil price at $60.08 and the DXY at 98.99 may lead to a positive mood in the TASI, driven by the potential for increased economic growth. However, the SP500 at 6870.40 and the Gold price at $4212.90 may also influence the TASI. The key drivers are the oil price, dollar strength, and global rates. The TASI forecast is neutral for this week.",
