  "ai_analysis": "The macro landscape is complex, with Oil at $57.44 and DXY at 98.39 indicating a moderate level of economic activity. The Gold price at $4300.10 suggests some safe-haven demand, while the SP500 at 6827.41 is near all-time highs. The TASI at 10715.98 is positive, driven by the Saudi economy. The key drivers for the week are: drivers[5]: Oil prices, DXY, 10Y Treasury Yield, Gold, and TASI. A DXY above 100 would be a concern, while an Oil price below $50 would indicate a more positive environment. The TASI mood is positive, with a forecast of continued growth.",
