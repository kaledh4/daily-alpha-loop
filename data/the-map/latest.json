The TASI and Saudi markets are likely to be impacted by these factors, with the dollar strength potentially weighing on oil prices and the TASI. The drivers of the TASI include the oil price, dollar strength, and global rates, which are currently aligned in a way that suggests a neutral to negative mood for the TASI. The likely directional bias for the TASI this week is slightly bearish.",
