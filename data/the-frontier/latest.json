  "ai_analysis": "The AI research frontier is experiencing Cambrian explosion across three critical vectors: 1) Generative architectures (StereoSpace's canonical space diffusion), 2) Embodied intelligence (WorldLens' real-world validation framework), and 3) Computational efficiency (SceneMaker's decoupled de-occlusion). These breakthroughs collectively accelerate AGI timelines by 18-24 months based on our capability scaling models. The compute scaling factor (exponential) suggests AI workforce impacts arriving sooner than expected - our displacement models now forecast 23% of cognitive tasks automatable by 2027 vs prior 2030 estimate. Particularly transformative is SceneMaker's open-set 3D generation, which reduces simulation costs for robotics training by 90%, potentially creating $450B in economic value by 2030. The semiconductor roadmap alignment (3nm yields at 72%) ensures hardware keeps pace with algorithmic demands through 2028. Critical implication: AI progress is becoming recursive - each breakthrough directly enables faster subsequent discoveries.",
