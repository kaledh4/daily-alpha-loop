  "ai_analysis": "Given the elevated risk level and bearish crypto momentum, a defensive stance is warranted. However, the moderate AI/Tech velocity and positive macro environment suggest opportunities for selective accumulation. We recommend a 60% equity allocation, with a focus on defensive sectors and a 20% allocation to AI/Tech-related assets. The remaining 20% should be held in cash or cash equivalents.",
