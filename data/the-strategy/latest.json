The tech breakthroughs, while significant, are not yet having a direct impact on the market. The unified market narrative today is one of caution and risk aversion, with a focus on short-term trading opportunities and defensive positioning. The stance is defensive, with a mindset of preserving capital and waiting for clearer market signals. The conviction level is medium, given the uncertainty and volatility in the market.",
