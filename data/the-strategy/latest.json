  "ai_analysis": "Synthesizing all signals, the current market narrative is one of caution and potential for disruption. The elevated risk level, bearish crypto momentum, and mixed macro sentiment suggest a defensive stance. However, the accelerating pace of tech breakthroughs and potential for oil price increases could provide opportunities for accumulation. The unified strategy should focus on risk management, selective accumulation in tech and oil, and close monitoring of market sentiment shifts.",
