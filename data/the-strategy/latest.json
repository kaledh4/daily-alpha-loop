The key is to balance these opposing forces, with a neutral stance and a focus on quality assets. The allocation recommendation is to maintain a moderate risk profile, with a mix of safe-haven assets and growth-oriented investments. The mindset is to be prepared for potential market volatility, while also being open to opportunities in the AI/Tech space. The conviction level is medium, as the market is likely to be choppy in the short term.",
