  "ai_analysis": "The strategy prioritizes BTC as the top opportunity, leveraging its strong momentum and favorable macro backdrop. A 10% allocation to BTC, with a 15% expected return and a 10% maximum drawdown, aligns with a medium\u2011risk tolerance. The stop\u2011loss at $85,000 protects against a sharp reversal, while the exit target at $95,000 captures the projected 3\u2011month rally. The portfolio allocation balances risk across asset classes, with 40% in crypto, 20% in equities, 10% in commodities, 10% in cash, and 20% in bonds. Risk\u2011adjusted scores place BTC at the top, followed by gold and TASI, reflecting their relative attractiveness. Correlation analysis shows a modest negative correlation between BTC and SPX, a positive correlation between gold and SPX, and a moderate positive correlation between BTC and gold, supporting diversification benefits. Overall, the plan offers a disciplined, data\u2011driven approach to capture upside while managing downside risk.",
