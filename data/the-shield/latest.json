  "ai_analysis": "The current MOVE Index at 67.28 is low compared to the 2022 average of 120, indicating a relatively stable market environment. However, the VIX at 15.41 is slightly elevated, suggesting some underlying volatility. The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.14% is near historical averages, while the bid-to-cover ratio of 2.43 is healthy. The JPY at 155.14 and CNH at 7.0679 are within expected ranges. Overall, systemic market fragility is moderate, with a potential for increased volatility due to geopolitical tensions. The current risk level is Elevated, with a top concern of rising interest rates impacting global economic growth.",
