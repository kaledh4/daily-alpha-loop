  "ai_analysis": "Overall market fragility remains low, evidenced by subdued volatility in both equity (VIX) and bond (MOVE) markets. However, the USD/JPY exchange rate has triggered a critical shock signal, indicating extreme yen weakness that presents a significant source of potential instability. Monitor this currency pair closely for central bank intervention, as it is the primary threat to the current market calm.",
