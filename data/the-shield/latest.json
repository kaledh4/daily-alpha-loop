  "ai_analysis": "The current MOVE Index of 67.28 is relatively low compared to the 2022 average of 120, indicating a lower volatility environment. However, the VIX at 15.41 is slightly elevated, suggesting some underlying market uncertainty. The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.14% is also worth monitoring, as it may impact risk appetite. The JPY at 155.14 and CNH at 7.0679 are within recent ranges, but yuan devaluation risk above 7.25 remains a concern.",
