  "ai_analysis": "The current market risk landscape is characterized by elevated volatility and stress points, with the VIX at 15.41 and the MOVE Index at 67.28, indicating a heightened sense of uncertainty among investors. The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.14% and the 10Y Bid-to-Cover at 2.43 suggest a moderate level of risk aversion. Professional traders should watch the JPY and CNH closely, as these currencies are highly sensitive to changes in global risk appetite.",
