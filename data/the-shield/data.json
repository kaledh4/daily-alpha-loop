  "ai_analysis": "Global risk pressure is moderately elevated, with the VIX at 15.74 indicating heightened volatility. The Fear & Greed Index at 21 suggests a 'Fear' classification, reflecting investor caution. The 10Y Treasury yield at 4.19% is stable, and the MOVE Index at 69.25 shows normal volatility in the Treasury market. The USD/JPY and USD/CNH pairs are trading within normal ranges, indicating stability in these currency pairs. Overall, while there are signs of risk aversion, the global risk environment is not excessively stressed, allowing for a measured approach to risk management.",
