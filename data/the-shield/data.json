  "ai_analysis": "Global risk pressure is moderate, with the VIX at 17.62 indicating elevated volatility. The Fear & Greed Index at 17 suggests extreme fear, which is consistent with the current market sentiment. The USD is strengthening slightly against the JPY and CNH, reflecting a flight to safety. Treasury yields are stable, and the MOVE index is within normal ranges, suggesting that while there is some volatility, it is not extreme. Cross-asset stress is present but manageable, with gold prices up slightly, indicating some safe-haven buying. Overall, the risk environment is cautious, with investors seeking stability in traditional safe-haven assets.",
