ETH's price at $3,045 reflects a similar downward momentum. Institutional flow into cryptocurrencies seems to be slowing down, with the Fear & Greed Index at 23, signaling extreme fear, which could be a contrarian buy signal for some investors. The key level to watch for BTC is the $80,000 support, as a break below this could lead to further selling pressure.",
