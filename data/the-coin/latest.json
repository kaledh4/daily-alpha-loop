  "ai_analysis": "The cryptocurrency market is currently experiencing a bearish trend, with BTC at $91,342 and ETH at $3,122. The BTC RSI of 36.61 indicates a potential oversold condition, which could lead to a bounce in the near term. However, the Fear & Greed Index at 20 suggests extreme fear among investors, which could lead to further downward pressure. A key level to watch is the $80,000 support level for BTC, which, if broken, could lead to a further decline. Conversely, a break above $100,000 could signal a trend reversal. The momentum is currently Bearish, but a rotation into ETH could provide a hedge against BTC's decline.",
