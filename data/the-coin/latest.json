  "ai_analysis": "The current crypto momentum is bearish, driven by a clear downtrend in BTC and widespread market fear. A low BTC RSI of 37.44 indicates weak buying pressure, though it is approaching oversold territory. The overall negative sentiment, as shown by the Fear & Greed index, reinforces the current lack of upward momentum.",
