  "ai_analysis": "The current BTC price of $89,672 and ETH price of $3,047 indicate a bearish trend, with BTC RSI at 37.54 and a Fear & Greed index of 20, suggesting extreme fear in the market. However, the recent ETF flows and smart money traders' bets on ETH decline could lead to a potential short squeeze. A key level to watch is the $80,000 support for BTC, which, if broken, could lead to further declines. On the other hand, a break above $100,000 could signal a trend reversal. The momentum is currently Bearish, but a potential rotation from BTC to ETH could occur if the ETH supply squeeze materializes. Portfolio implications include a 20% allocation to BTC and 30% to ETH, with a stop-loss at $70,000 for BTC and $2,500 for ETH.",
