  "ai_analysis": "The cryptocurrency market is currently in a bearish trend, with BTC price at $89,685 and ETH price at $3,048. The BTC RSI at 37.54 indicates oversold conditions, which could lead to a potential rebound. However, the Fear & Greed Index at 20 suggests extreme fear in the market, which could lead to further downward pressure. A key level to watch is the $80,000 support level for BTC, which could trigger a bullish reversal if broken. ETH, on the other hand, is showing relative strength compared to BTC, with a potential rotation into ETH if the $2,800 support level holds.",
