  "ai_analysis": "The crypto momentum landscape is currently in a state of mild bearishness, as evidenced by the 3\u2011point momentum score and the 4\u2011point rotation strength. Bitcoin\u2019s dominance remains high at 56.86%, but altcoins are slowly gaining market share, as reflected in the Alts.D of 43.14%. This gradual shift indicates a potential rotation from Bitcoin to altcoins, but the momentum remains weak, suggesting that the rotation is not yet fully materialized.\n\nThe setup quality score of 5.0 (average) indicates that the technical environment is neither strongly bullish nor strongly bearish. The RSI for Bitcoin is at 45.0, which is below the 50\u2011level, confirming a mild bearish bias. Ethereum\u2019s price relative to Bitcoin (ETH/BTC 0.0345) is stable, implying that Ethereum is not outpacing Bitcoin in terms of market share.\n\nOn the macro side, the Fear & Greed index at 21 and the VIX at 15.74 reinforce a risk\u2011off sentiment that could dampen any bullish momentum in the crypto space. The DXY at 98.39 and the 10\u2011year Treasury yield at 4.19% further support the notion that the dollar remains strong and that fixed\u2011income markets are under pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, the crypto market is in a cautious phase. While altcoins are slowly gaining traction, the overall momentum is weak, and the macro environment is risk\u2011off. Investors should adopt a defensive stance, focusing on liquidity and risk management, while keeping an eye on potential catalysts that could shift the market into a bullish regime.",
