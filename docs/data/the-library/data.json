  "query": "What drives crypto bull markets?",
  "simplified_answer": "Crypto bull markets are primarily driven by a combination of technological advancements, institutional adoption, and macroeconomic factors. Technological breakthroughs, such as the development of new blockchain protocols and decentralized applications, often spark investor interest and drive prices higher. Institutional adoption, including investments from hedge funds and corporations, provides liquidity and legitimacy to the crypto market. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions, such as low interest rates and inflation concerns, can push investors towards crypto as a store of value and hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Market sentiment, influenced by media coverage and social media trends, also plays a significant role in fueling bull markets. Overall, the convergence of these factors creates a positive feedback loop, attracting more investors and driving up prices.",
