  "query": "What drives crypto bull markets?",
  "simplified_answer": "Crypto bull markets are primarily driven by a combination of factors, including technological advancements, institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, and macroeconomic conditions. Technological innovations, such as the development of new blockchain protocols and decentralized applications, often spark investor interest and drive market growth. Institutional adoption, as seen with the entry of major financial institutions and corporations into the crypto space, provides credibility and liquidity to the market. Regulatory clarity, which reduces uncertainty and provides a framework for crypto operations, can also fuel bull markets. Additionally, favorable macroeconomic conditions, such as low-interest rates and quantitative easing, can encourage investors to seek higher yields in cryptocurrencies. Overall, a confluence of these factors creates an environment conducive to crypto bull markets, attracting both retail and institutional investors.",
