  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk toggle. The VIX is below 15, indicating a potential Risk-On bias, but the Fear & Greed index remains in the 'Fear' zone, reinforcing a defensive bias. The macro environment shows energy strength and a rising AI breakthrough frequency, suggesting a mixed frontier stance. The core allocation remains valid, but the frontier stance and sector focus have shifted. The portfolio should maintain a core allocation of 90% crypto and 10% gold, with a focus on alt-rotation in crypto. The sectors to focus on are Energy, Technology, and Banking, with a mixed regional allocation.",
