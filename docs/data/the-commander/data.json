  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk stance. The core allocation remains valid, but adjustments are made based on new data. The frontier stance is neutral, allowing for gradual shifts towards aggressiveness if AI breakthroughs continue. Energy and Banking sectors are favored due to oil strength and moderately positive rate path impact. Technology sector is also considered due to increasing AI breakthrough frequency.",
