  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk state. The VIX below 15 and Fear & Greed index at 23 suggest a defensive bias, but the falling policy rates and stable crypto prices indicate potential for risk-on. The energy sector is favored due to oil price stability and TASI strength. Technology is also a focus due to positive QQQ changes and AI breakthroughs. The frontier stance is neutral, balancing innovation potential with current market caution.",
