  "ai_analysis": "The current environment is transitional with falling rates supporting risk assets. The defensive stance is maintained due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. Energy and banking sectors are favored due to oil price strength and falling rates. The core crypto allocation remains with a BTC-heavy stance due to high BTC dominance and ETH weakness. Gold is held steady with no strong signal for rotation. The old stand is partially valid, with the macro assumption needing an update to reflect falling rates.",
