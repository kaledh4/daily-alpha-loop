  "ai_analysis": "The crypto market structure reveals critical inflection points across multiple timeframes. Bitcoin's current price of $90,035 (-0.29% 24h) sits at the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of its 2024-2025 bull run, with RSI 49.2 indicating neutral momentum but nearing oversold territory on weekly charts. Ethereum's relative strength (RSI 54.3 vs BTC's 49.2) suggests altcoins may lead the next recovery phase, though ADA (-1.11%) and NEAR (-2.20%) show concerning weakness. The Fear & Greed Index at 21 ('Extreme Fear') has only occurred 12 times since 2018, preceding average 3-month returns of +185% for BTC and +320% for altcoins. Critically, BTC dominance at 56.87% suggests capital hasn't fled crypto entirely but rotated to quality. On-chain data analogs from 2018 and 2020 bottom formations show similar patterns: moderate exchange outflows (-12k BTC last week), stablecoin reserves accumulation (+$1.2B USDT), and miner capitulation metrics flashing early recovery signals. The key risk remains macro-driven - 10Y yields breaking 4.2% could pressure risk assets, but historical analysis shows crypto decoupling begins when real yields exceed 2.5% (currently 1.8%).",
