  "ai_analysis": "The current environment is transitional with a cautious optimism. The VIX is in the transitional range, and the Fear & Greed index reinforces a defensive bias. Crypto internal rotation is allowed due to BTC dominance being below 55%. Macro signals favor energy and regional exposure due to oil strength and TASI relative strength. The defensive frontier stance is maintained due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. The old stand is partially valid, with updates needed for the macro assumption and frontier stance.",
