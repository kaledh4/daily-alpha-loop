  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional with a slight accommodative bias from the rate path. The portfolio should maintain a BTC-heavy stance in crypto due to ETH weakness and a BTC dominance below 55%. In metals, holding gold is advised due to stable prices. The energy sector shows strength with increasing oil prices and TASI relative strength, warranting a higher allocation. The frontier stance is neutral due to rising AI breakthrough frequency, but caution is maintained due to VIX levels above 20.",
