The macro landscape is slightly positive, but the cryptocurrency market is bearish. The AI and tech landscape is experiencing a moderate level of velocity, with potential breakthroughs in AI model accuracy and data processing. The rotation into AI and tech-related assets is a key signal, as it has the potential to provide a hedge against the bearish cryptocurrency market and the slightly positive macro landscape. The second-order effect of this rotation is the potential for increased investment in AI and tech-related assets, which could lead to further breakthroughs and advancements in the field. The third-order effect is the potential for a shift in the overall market narrative, from a focus on macro and cryptocurrency to a focus on AI and tech.",
