  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional with a slight risk-on bias due to easing policy rates. The crypto market favors BTC given its dominance and ETH weakness. Energy and Technology sectors show strength, with a focus on Saudi exposure and AI innovation. The defensive frontier stance is maintained due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. The old stand is partially valid, with adjustments in sector focus.",
