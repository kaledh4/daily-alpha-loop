    "why_it_matters": "The rising interest rates could impact equity markets, leading to a decline in the SP500 and TASI. The DXY is also near its recent highs, which could support the US dollar and impact emerging markets. The Gold price is relatively high, suggesting a safe-haven bid. The cross-dashboard convergence suggests a Defensive stance, with a focus on risk management. The action stance is to reduce exposure to equity markets and increase exposure to safe-haven assets. The optional deep insight is to monitor the AI/Tech sector for potential opportunities. The clarity level is Medium, given the uncertainty in the market. The summary sentence is to be cautious and focus on risk management.",
    "cross_dashboard_convergence": "The Risk, Crypto, Macro, and Tech dashboards are currently converging on a Defensive stance, with a focus on risk management. The rising interest rates and high DXY suggest a potential decline in equity markets, while the low RSI and extreme fear index in Crypto suggest a potential buying opportunity. The AI/Tech sector is showing Moderate velocity, which could provide opportunities for Accumulative strategies.",
