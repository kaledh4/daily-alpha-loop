  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional with a cautious sentiment. The VIX is below 15, indicating Risk-On eligibility, but the Fear & Greed index is at 23 (Extreme Fear), reinforcing a defensive bias. The falling interest rates support risk assets, but the overall market shows signs of caution. The crypto allocation remains BTC-heavy due to high BTC Dominance and ETH weakness. The metals allocation holds Gold with no strong signals for rotation. The sectors in focus are Energy and Banking, with a mixed regional approach. The frontier stance remains Defensive due to lack of data on AI breakthrough frequency.",
