  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is cautiously optimistic with a transitional risk state. The VIX at 14.0 indicates a risk-on eligible environment, but the Fear & Greed index at 24 reinforces a defensive bias. The crypto market shows BTC strength with a dominance of 57.41%, suggesting a BTC-heavy stance. Macro indicators show energy strength with oil prices rising and TASI showing relative strength. The AI breakthrough frequency is flat, maintaining a defensive frontier stance. The old stand is partially valid, with adjustments needed in the macro assumption and frontier stance. The best return-to-risk allocation favors energy, technology, and banking sectors, along with holding gold.",
