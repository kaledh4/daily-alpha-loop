  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment is transitional with a slight risk-off bias due to VIX being at 20.09. The Fed Funds Rate is trending downwards, which may benefit the banking sector. Energy shows strength, and the frontier stance remains defensive due to flat AI breakthrough frequency. The core allocation of 90% Crypto and 10% Gold is partially valid, with a preference for BTC due to ETH weakness.",
