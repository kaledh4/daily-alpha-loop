  "ai_analysis": "The current market environment shows a transitional risk state with a cautious optimism. The VIX below 15 indicates a potential risk-on environment, but the Fear & Greed index below 25 reinforces a defensive bias. Crypto allocation remains BTC-heavy due to ETH weakness. Energy sector shows strength, and the AI breakthrough frequency is flat, maintaining a defensive frontier stance. The old stand is partially valid, with adjustments needed in the frontier stance and risk state. The best return-to-risk allocation favors energy, technology, and banking sectors, along with a hold on gold and a BTC-heavy crypto stance.",
