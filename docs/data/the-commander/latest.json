  "ai_analysis": "The market is in a transitional state with falling policy rates supporting risk assets. The crypto portfolio should maintain a BTC-heavy stance due to ETH weakness and transitional VIX levels. The metals portfolio should hold gold due to its strength. Sector focus should be on Energy and Banking, with a mixed regional approach. The frontier stance remains defensive due to flat AI innovation and transitional market conditions.",
