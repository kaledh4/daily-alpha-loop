  "ai_analysis": "The BTC price at $90,321 and ETH price at $3,090 are both below their recent highs, indicating a Bearish momentum. The BTC RSI at 35.30 is in oversold territory, which could lead to a bounce. However, the Fear & Greed index at 23 is in Extreme Fear, suggesting a high level of market anxiety. A break below $80,000 for BTC could trigger a further decline, while a break above $100,000 could lead to a rally. The ETH/BTC ratio is currently favorable for ETH, suggesting a potential rotation into altcoins. The key level to watch is $80,000 for BTC.",
