  "ai_analysis": "Crypto markets are currently experiencing a bearish trend, with BTC's RSI at 37.45 and a Fear & Greed index of 23, indicating extreme fear among investors. ETH's price at $3,043 and BTC's price at $89,492 suggest a potential for further decline, but institutional flow, as seen in BitMine's $199M ETH purchase, could indicate a potential reversal. The key level to watch for BTC is the $80,000 support, while ETH's $2,800 level is crucial for maintaining bullish momentum.",
