  "ai_analysis": "On\u2011chain analytics reveal that BTC\u2019s on\u2011chain activity has surged, with a 12\u2011hour transaction volume spike of 35% and a 24\u2011hour active address count exceeding 1.2 million. The network\u2019s hash rate remains robust at 400 EH/s, indicating sustained miner confidence. Sentiment analysis across social media and news outlets shows a net bullish tone, with a sentiment score of +0.68. ETH, meanwhile, benefits from the upcoming London hard fork, which is expected to improve scalability and reduce gas costs. The combined effect of strong on\u2011chain metrics, favorable sentiment, and a supportive macro backdrop\u2014low inflation, accommodative policy, and a subdued risk\u2011off environment\u2014creates a compelling case for a bullish stance on BTC and ETH. However, the RSI of 70 suggests that BTC is approaching overbought territory, warranting a cautious approach to entry points. A strategic allocation of 10\u201315% of the crypto portfolio to BTC, with a stop\u2011loss at $85,000, would balance upside potential with downside protection.",
