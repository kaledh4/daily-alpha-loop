  "ai_analysis": "AI research is accelerating at a pace that suggests a rapid convergence toward AGI. The compute doubling interval of 18 months, coupled with a 15% annual efficiency improvement, implies that the cost of training a next\u2011generation model will fall dramatically. The research velocity index of 0.85 indicates a high density of breakthroughs, and the recent milestone of a language model surpassing GPT\u20114 underscores the tangible progress. Workforce impact is significant: a 30% annual automation rate and a 15\u201330% risk for coding and creative roles signal a shift toward higher\u2011skill, higher\u2011value jobs. The net displacement forecast indicates that, over the next 36 months, displaced workers could constitute up to 15% of the workforce, necessitating proactive reskilling initiatives. Investors should overweight AI infrastructure and defense cybersecurity, while underweighting traditional tech that may become obsolete. The conviction of 0.7 reflects a strong belief in the upside of AI\u2011driven assets.",
