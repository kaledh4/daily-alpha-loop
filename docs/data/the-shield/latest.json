With the current fragility index indicating a moderate level of market fragility and the potential for increased volatility, allocating a portion of the portfolio to gold can provide a buffer against potential downside risks. Gold's positive change in the data further supports its role as a hedge, as it has shown resilience and even appreciation in the face of market uncertainties. This allocation is particularly relevant given the risk-on sentiment driven by AI advancements, as it allows investors to participate in the potential upside while mitigating the risks associated with market volatility."

The slight increase in the VIX, coupled with the rising cross-asset correlation, suggests that market uncertainty is on the rise. By allocating a portion of the portfolio to volatility ETFs, investors can benefit from any significant market sell-offs or spikes in volatility. This strategy complements the risk-on stance by providing a hedge against the downside, ensuring that the portfolio is well-protected against potential market corrections or crashes."
