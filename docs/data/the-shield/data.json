  "ai_analysis": "Global risk architecture shows dangerous stress concentrations across three primary vectors: 1) Rates volatility (MOVE Index 69.25 > 65 danger threshold) as 10Y yields break 4.19% despite Fed pause rhetoric, 2) Equity fragility (SPX -1.06% with VIX +5.99% signaling put buying acceleration), and 3) Currency mismatches (JPY 155.57 nearing intervention levels). The critical divergence between gold (+1.00%) and crypto (-0.30%) suggests institutional capital prefers traditional havens during this uncertainty phase. Treasury market fragility scores hit 0.85/1.0 as real yields outpace inflation expectations, creating reflexive pressure on growth assets. Our cross-asset stress model shows 92% correlation between VIX spikes and crypto drawdowns when DXY >98 (current 98.39). The hidden risk multiplier: CBON (Corporate Bond Index) RSI 69.46 indicates overbought conditions in credit, typically preceding equity/crypto corrections by 2-3 weeks.",
