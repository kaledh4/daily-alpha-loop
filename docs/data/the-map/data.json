  "ai_analysis": "Energy strength is indicated by oil prices rising (price change +0.84%) and TASI showing relative strength (price change +0.41%). This suggests favorable energy and regional exposure. The Fed Funds rate at 3.88% and DXY weakness (price change -0.38%) suggest favorable banking sector conditions."
