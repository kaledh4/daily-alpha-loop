Oil prices are stable, and gold is up slightly, indicating some safe-haven buying. The DXY is strengthening, reflecting a flight to safety. Treasury yields are stable, suggesting that while there is some volatility, it is not extreme. The TASI mood is cautious, reflecting regional economic uncertainties and geopolitical tensions. Overall, the macro environment is supportive of a defensive investment stance, with investors seeking stability in traditional safe-haven assets.",
