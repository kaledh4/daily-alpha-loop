  "ai_analysis": "Global macroeconomic conditions reflect a precarious balance between inflation stickiness and growth concerns. The S&P 500's neutral RSI (54.66) and flat performance indicate market indecision, while TASI's 34 RSI suggests oversold conditions in emerging markets despite Saudi energy stability. Oil prices ($55.96) show resilience but remain 18% below 2022 peaks, constraining fiscal budgets in oil-dependent economies. Gold's overbought RSI (77.36) conflicts with its safe-haven role given elevated risk aversion, suggesting speculative positioning. The US yield curve remains inverted across key maturities (2s10s at -0.32), increasing recession probability to 38% according to AI models analyzing Fed policy lags. This creates a 'stagflation paradox' where tight monetary policy risks demand collapse without solving inflation. AI-driven supply chain analytics predict 15% semiconductor shortages in Q1 2026 due to geopolitical fragmentation, potentially disrupting tech sector recoveries. Cross-asset correlations at 0.62 - the highest since 2020 - indicate synchronized risk pricing, with defensive sectors outperforming cyclicals by 1.8x. The 3-month forecast suggests 65% probability of range-bound trading until inflation data forces a policy pivot, with crypto markets likely to amplify moves due to lower liquidity buffers.",
