The DXY is high, indicating a strong US dollar, which may negatively impact emerging markets. The TASI is also influenced by the Saudi market, which is experiencing a neutral mood. The drivers of the TASI are the oil prices, dollar strength, and global rates. The TASI forecast is neutral, with a potential bias towards the downside.",
