The 10Y Treasury Yield at 4.14% suggests a relatively stable interest rate environment. The TASI at 10629.62 is neutral, with a positive bias for the week due to the potential for oil price increases. The SP500 at 6870.40 is near historical highs, suggesting a potential for consolidation. The Gold price at $4212.90 is elevated, indicating some safe-haven demand. Drivers for the week include oil prices, interest rates, and global events. The TASI mood is Neutral, with a forecast of sideways movement.",
