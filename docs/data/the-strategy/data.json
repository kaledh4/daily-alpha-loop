  "ai_analysis": "Given the current market conditions, a defensive stance with an opportunistic mindset is advised. The crypto market is in a bearish trend, with extreme fear indicators suggesting potential buying opportunities if the market stabilizes. The global risk environment is cautious, with investors seeking stability in traditional safe-haven assets. The macro environment is neutral, with some safe-haven buying observed. However, the frontier of technology, particularly in AI research, shows active innovation, which could drive future economic growth and create new investment opportunities. Investors should focus on high-quality assets with strong fundamentals and be prepared to act on potential contrarian opportunities in the crypto space.",
