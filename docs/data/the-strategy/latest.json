  "ai_analysis": "The unified market narrative today is one of caution and risk aversion, with the elevated VIX and MOVE Index readings suggesting a high level of uncertainty. The bearish crypto momentum and neutral to negative TASI mood also contribute to a defensive stance. However, the exponential velocity of AI and tech breakthroughs suggests that there may be opportunities for accumulation and growth in the long term. The strategic approach for today is defensive, with a focus on managing risk and preserving capital.",
