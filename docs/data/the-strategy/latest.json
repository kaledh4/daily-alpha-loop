  "ai_analysis": "Our strategic framework synthesizes conflicting signals into actionable allocations: 1) Core crypto position (BTC/ETH) at 35% target (vs 50% max), using $88.5k BTC as accumulation zone with 3:1 risk/reward, 2) AI-centric equities (semiconductors, cloud infra) at 25% given exponential research trajectory, 3) Macro hedges (gold miners, long-duration treasuries) at 20%, and 4) Dry powder reserve at 20% for volatility spikes. The asymmetric opportunity lies in crypto's negative convexity - maximum pain scenarios project 15% further downside versus 120% upside potential within 6 months. Portfolio construction emphasizes: a) Staggered limit orders below $90k BTC, b) AI compute options (NVDA Jan'26 $1500 calls), c) Gold bullion (5% physical allocation). Critical watch: Treasury liquidity crisis could force Fed intervention, creating reflexive crypto rally. Exit triggers: BTC dominance breaking <54% (altseason start) or VIX >25 sustained.",
