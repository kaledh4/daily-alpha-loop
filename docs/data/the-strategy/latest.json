  "ai_analysis": "Given the defensive posture suggested by the macro analysis and the opportunistic outlook in the AI/tech sector, the overall stance should be cautiously accumulative. The strategy involves a balanced portfolio with a slight overweight in tech and a underweight in sectors sensitive to interest rate changes. The mindset should be prepared for potential volatility but also positioned to capitalize on dips in growth sectors. Conviction in this strategy is medium, as it balances between the current bearish crypto momentum and the potential for a reversal, alongside the positive but cautious macro outlook.",
