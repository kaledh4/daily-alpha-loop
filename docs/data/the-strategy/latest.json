  "ai_analysis": "The current strategy is Defensive, due to the Elevated risk level and Bearish crypto momentum. However, the Moderate AI/Tech velocity and Neutral macro environment suggest that there are opportunities for accumulation. The key is to be selective and focus on high-quality assets with strong growth potential. A possible allocation is 40% equities, 30% bonds, 20% alternatives, and 10% cash. The mindset is to be cautious and opportunistic, taking advantage of dips in the market to accumulate high-quality assets. The conviction level is Medium, as the current environment is uncertain and subject to change.",
